					My name is Lu, Jia-Zhen. I am a college student in National Tsing Hua Universtiy now. My major is Foreign Language and Literature. I like reading literature and books. Besides the texts that the professor assigns in the courses, recently, I read lots of books written by Japanese authors. I enjoy very much the slow pace and tranquil environment in the books very much. With their gentle style of writing, I get serenity when reading. That’s why I love to read some of the Japanese literature. 

In addition to my studies in school, I also do part time job in my free time. Currently, I work as an English teacher in a cram school near the campus. My students are second and third grade in elementary school. What I teach them is to recognize the English alphabet. The most difficult part in teaching them is to design some games which can help them to remember those words quickly, but for most of the time, I’m happy to see them learn with joy and have progress. 
About my personality, although I am a shy person, I am a good listener. I enjoy listening to others’ stories. It is very interesting to know others and learn from their experiences. It is also an important way to learn more about the world. We can only live our own lives, but we know lots of fun and exciting adventures by listening. Except for collecting others’ experiences, listening is an important teamwork skill. It’s only when you understand others’ perspectives, that you know how to persuade and influence them. 
Besides, I am also a person who’s concerned about climate change as a global issue. I had gone to a study club to learn the topic of Sustainable Development Goals last semester. More and more people care about these goals nowadays because the aim is to help solve the urgent and catastrophic problems around the globe. I hope I could contribute some effort to help in the future, too.
