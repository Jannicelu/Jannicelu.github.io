But the earliest one of well-known epidemics must be the BlackDeath, which broke out in the Middle Age and killed almost one third of the population of Europe.At that time, the lack of hygiene knowledge made it hard to cut down the access of spreading andprotect people against the disease. For instance, people in the Middle Ages almost had noknowledge about microbes, let alone Yersinia Pestis, a bacterium mostly carried by rats, which isable to spread the Black Death among people. Instead, they tended to view the disease as thepunishment of God or some supernatural power, which was a false belief that prevented patientsfrom getting proper treatment. Despite lacking limited hygiene knowledge, some useful methodshad come up at that time, such as quarantine.
