		<h1>Summer Camp!</h1>
		<section>		
			In 2019, I joined a summer camp called ” 2K19 NTUST x Project LET’S GO! Summer program in Taiwan” for one month. It’s a service-learning summer camp, so college students from Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Japan, Mexico and Europe were recruited to become volunteer teachers to hold an international bilingual summer camp in Siaolin Village, Kaohsiung. The whole month was divided into three parts. The first part was “teacher training” for volunteer teachers. For the second and third parts, we had two sections summer camp for elementary school students, and each section took five days. Except for Siaolin elementary school students, all student participants from Kaohsiung city could also join in, because we aimed for people to see the beauty of Siaolin village. For me, it was an unforgettable month! I met lots of interesting people, and created colorful memories with them.

			在2019年的暑假，我參加了台科大與Project LET’S GO! 共同主辦的志工夏令營，為期一個月，與來自台灣、東南亞、日本、墨西哥與歐洲的大學生，一起到高雄的山區—小林村擔任志工老師，為當地的小學生舉辦國際雙語夏令營。夏令營的第一個禮拜是志工老師的訓練期，接著再到小林村當地舉辦兩梯次的雙語夏令營，除了小林國小的學生，高雄市區的小學生也能報名參加，因為主辦單位希望更多人認識小林村!那一個月是非常特別即難忘的經驗!認識了很多有趣的人，收穫了豐富的美好回憶!

			In the first week of the summer camp, all of the volunteer teachers united and had a week-long training in National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST). Lots of work had to be done during the training. We had to design a five-day course and different activities. The theme of the camp was "universe" and we had to integrate it into four subjects, which were Science, Art, Music and English. I was in the Music group. After our discussion within the period of five days, we designed to teach the “eight planets” and tempo, which was for English and music learning respectively. Therefore, first we adapted the lyrics of cup song “Cup”, sung by Anna Kendrick. The adaption was with the vocabulary of eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in the lyrics. And then in summer camp, students had to learn how to sing the song and the accompaniment, the “cup game” for its percussion, together. These comprised our courses arrangement in the morning. In addition, for the afternoon and evening schedule, we had some interesting activities like stargazing or barbecue. It was a special experience staying with the people you just met that day for twenty four hours and actively discussing with them. It forced me to open my mind quickly even though I was a shy person.

			營期的第一週，所有的志工老師都前往台科大接受志工老師的訓練，也藉機會認識彼此，畢竟在未來的一個月內必須要每天24小時相處在一起。在那一週裡，每一組都必須設計出五天的課程內容，以及不同的團體活動，一共有四個科目:自然、藝術、音樂、英文，而我們必須將營隊的主題「宇宙」融進不同的科目，我分配到音樂組，經過討論後，我們決定要教八大行星及節奏，我們改編了Anna Kendrick唱的「杯子歌」，將八大行星的英文單字改編進歌詞裡，接著在營隊中教學生如何唱這首歌，用杯子打節奏，並挑戰同時做到進行這兩項任務。除了課程內容，我們也在營期的下午及晚上時間規劃了觀星、烤肉等活動。與才剛認識的同學一起規劃課程、設計活動是很特別的經驗，即便我是一個害羞的人，也必須要強迫自己快速地融入大家。

			On the fourth day of the teacher instruction, we had to go to different sightseeing spots and completed some tasks in Taipei city for a whole day as a group, which included foreign volunteer teachers in every group. It was interesting to show those famous spots to foreign volunteer teachers, or to see them eat those special Taiwan snacks, such as stinky tofu or century egg. This activity impressed me a lot.

			在訓練期的第四天，所有的志工老師以組為單位，每組至少一位外國人，前往台北的各個觀光景點執行任務，與國外的志工老師去不同的觀光景點，讓他們品嘗台灣的臭豆腐或皮蛋，是很有趣的活動，讓我印象非常深刻。

			On the weekend of the first week, we took a long trip to Siaolin Village. I was amazed by the fantastic scenery of nature there. The mountain was surrounded by the cloud, and the air was pure. We visited the “Siaolin Memorial Park” next day. When I saw the names of people who died due to the landslide resulted from Typhoon Morakot, I couldn't help but feel mournful. Shown there were the evidences of some living people who died immediately because of the accident. What’s more miserable was when the docent pointed out one name, and said “this was my son”. At that moment, I had much fierce sorrow, because I suddenly realized that death was so close to us.

			結束了五天的訓練，週末時，我們搭乘了遊覽車前往小林村。當我抵達小林村時，我被美麗的自然風景深深吸引住了，遠山雲霧繚繞，空氣也非常清爽。我們參觀了小林村紀念公園，當我看到那些因為莫拉克颱風導致的土石流而去世的人的名字，覺得非常心痛，因為那些名字代表著曾經活生生的人，突然之間就去世了，更令我悲傷的是，當導覽員指著一個名字，並且告訴我們:「這是我兒子。」，我非常震驚，突然之間覺得死亡離我們好近好近。

			Then, students of first section came! Actually, I felt a little nervous at first, because I hadn’t gotten along with so many children before that. I feared that I couldn’t catch what they wanted to share, or I had no interesting topic to chat with them. However, my partners helped me a lot so I became relaxed.

			接著，第一梯次的夏令營開始了! 其實一開始，我覺得有點緊張，因為我並沒有與那麼多小學生同時相處的經驗，很怕自己不瞭解他們想表達的，或是沒有有趣的話題能跟他們聊，但因為有其他的志工老師夥伴在旁邊幫忙，所以我變得比較放鬆。

			The most memorable experience for me was to teach them how to play the cup song. Before that camp, I didn’t know how to play it, but I learned it with my partners because we had to demonstrate. Actually, it was not that easy to do it. I got a sense of achievement after I made it! Then, when all of the six teachers played it together, the feeling doubled. I still can remember the night that we practiced it in the classroom and successfully achieved at the end. I loved it. However, it was a totally different circumstance when we taught children. Some of them have already learned it before, but some had two left feet when they had to sing and play the cups at the same time. Therefore, we spent lots of time to practice with them because we needed to perform in front of children’s parents at the end of the camp. Although it was tired, but when they finally did a great job during the performance, I felt so touched and relieved.

			營期間最讓我懷念的就是教小孩怎麼唱與打杯子歌，因為其實在營期前我是不會打的，但因為必須示範，所以我們這組的老師一起學怎麼打，也才發現其實並沒有那麼容易，但是當我真正學會時，非常有成就感，尤其是當我們六個志工老師一起表演時，成就感是加倍的!我到現在都還記得我們一起在教室練習，然後成功辦到的那個晚上，我真的很喜歡這個經驗!不過，當我們要教學生時又是完全不同的情況了，他們之中，有些人已經學過了，有些人卻是手腳不協調，沒有辦法一邊唱歌一邊打節奏，所以我們花了非常多時間陪他們練習，因為在營期
			的最後一天，他們必須要上台表演給他們的家長看，雖然練習時覺得非常累，但當他們最後在台上表現得不錯時，我覺得很感動，而且鬆了一口氣。

			In addition to the theme classes taught indoors, we also had outdoor activities, such as water polo, visitation of Siaolin Pingpu Cultural Museum, and so on. I had a very good time with the children, and was impressed by the unsophisticated heart of kids. They easily fought for some petty thing, yet then became friends effortlessly. In a nutshell, I had fascinating memories with the children in the first section.

			除了教室內的課程，也有很多的室外活動，像是水球大戰、或是參觀小林平埔文化博物館等等，在過程中，我與小孩們相處的很開心，也對他們單純的心靈印象深刻，雖然上一秒他們在為一些很小的事情吵架，下一秒卻又變成好朋友了，總之，我在第一梯次留下了很美好的回憶。

			Nevertheless, the second section had to be stopped on the third day because there was a typhoon around Taiwan. It was sad to say goodbye to Siaolin children and the beautiful place.

			然而，很遺憾的是因為颱風的打擾，所以第二梯次在第三天時就被迫結束了，跟小林村的美麗風景及小孩說再見時，我覺得非常不捨。

			The experience that summer was the best I've ever had. I encountered a group of friendly and interesting people, and I learned a lot from them. We had very good cooperation. I appreciated our effort to accomplish the camp. I haven’t stayed with people from different countries for so long, so it was a new experience. Besides, I also benefited from the children. They made me laugh out loud, and I was also emotionally touched by them. I gained lots of invaluable memories. Last, I found myself become more open-minded after that camp. I also trusted myself more. All in all, it affected me in many ways. I hope I could take the lessons I learned and help more people in the future!

			那一個夏天的經驗是我從來沒有體驗過的，遇到了一群友善又有趣的朋友，從他們身上學到非常多，相處合作也很愉快，一起努力完成了那次的營隊是值得讚賞的事情!因為我從來沒有過跟外國人相處這麼長時間的經驗，所以這對我來說也是全新的經驗!此外，我也從小孩身上學到了很多，他們讓我大笑，讓我感動，收穫了許多無價的回憶。最後，最重要的是我發現自己變得比較大方，也更相信自己了!總之，營隊經驗影響了我很多部分，我希望自己能帶著所學，未來幫助更多人!
