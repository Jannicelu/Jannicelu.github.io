				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				"Kitchen” is a Japanese book with three chapters. The first and second are parts of a series, and this article will focus on them. It tells a story of a young man and a young woman recovering from their family members’ death, and find courage through the company of different kinds of people. Although this book pays attention to “death”, it gives us great warmth by proving that people can be brave enough to stand up again from the company of friends who are still alive, and their shared memories with the person who died. The tone is approachable and tender which make readers feel relieved and soothing.

				The first chapter is “Kitchen”. it’s about the female protagonist, Meiying(美影), loses her grandmother who raised her up.

				<h4>書本介紹</h4>
				《廚房》這本書分成三個章節，第一章與第二章是兩個相連的故事，而第三章則是獨立的另一個故事，此篇心得只談論第一章及第二章的故事。這本書雖然圍繞著如何面對死亡這個主題上，但卻是一本非常溫暖的書，作者用平易近人的筆調，描寫了面對親人死亡的痛苦，由於透過不同形式的陪伴，慢慢找回生活下去的動力的過程。其中，第一、二章的故事講述了關於兩個年輕人如何面對家人的死亡，以及，在療傷的過程中，他們如何靠近彼此的故事。

				<h1>Reflection</h1>
				“Company” is the theme of this book. What does “company” mean in the story? It refers to the understanding of someone’s situation. It’s because Meiying and Yuichi have an identical feeling and reliance on the people who pass away, they can realize and understand the other person’s sorrow. They believe that the other person is as mournful as themselves, so they can rely on each other. That’s the reason why they can find warmth from having and trusting each other. 
			</section>
			<section id="A3">
				Actually, there are lots of different kinds of company. For example, recalling the memories when everyone was still together is a kind of company. Although the dead person’s life ends, he is still alive in the characters' memories!Recollecting how they stayed with each other before gives people a sense of security. For instance, in the story, Meiying remembers the time when her grandmother had tea in the living room, and Yuichi’s mother commended her when she was wearing the sweater… and so on. With these recollections, she can face all the loneliness and find meaning amidst her lost.

			Quote: “Without thorough desperation, people won’t fathom what can be given up from them. In this way, they can’t realize the real happiness.”
			</section>
			<section id="A3">
				What’s happiness? In this story, Meiying mentions this question several times. She keeps reminding readers to think of this question. I think it’s a question without an answer, because the feeling of happiness depends on the context. According to different personalities, experiences or surroundings, people’s reactions can vary. Therefore, we can’t have a standard for happiness. Likewise, we can’t say that desperation is awful. In some circumstances, despair makes us understand what happiness is. These two elements fill our life, and build our life.

				Quote: “After losing Yuichi’s mother, we both were soaked in the darkness. However, we ran hard to meet another bright at the same time.”

				This writing brings the  readers to a feeling of dream-reality situation. Some of the plots are a little impossible in real life. Something that showed up in their dream also happens in real life, and real events aren’t that definite. For example, Meiying and Yuichi have the same dream and discuss about it when they wake up. I think it relates to Meiying’s condition. Because the sadness is too overwhelming, she hasn’t accepted the death of her grandmother and Yuichi’s mother.  This story is told from Meiying’s first-person narrative, so it gives us a sense of uncertainty and insecurity.

				Words like “loneliness” or “alone” are constantly mentioned, but instead of coldness, the story provides a lot of warmth. Just like the kitchen in every house, it makes people  think of delicious warm meals and the precious time that family members share together!  That’s the magic of a company. That’s why Meiying and Yuichi can have power again just by having each other!

				<h4>心得</h4>
				陪伴，是〈廚房〉這個故事所想要傳達的，但陪伴並不是與他人待在一起就好，還須要有能夠理解彼此的心。美影與雄一之所以能夠在兩次打擊之後，願意相信彼此，在對方身上找到溫暖的力量，是因為他們對於死亡之人有著一樣的依戀，透過理解彼此的悲傷，他們才成為了互相依賴的兩個人。
				陪伴的形式有很多種，其實透過思念，回憶與過世家人相處的點點滴滴，也是陪伴的一種。回想相處的過程，是一件令人感到溫暖的事，雖然過世之人永遠消失了，可是透過記憶，他還是會繼續存在於想念他的人心中。在故事裡，有好幾次寫到回憶的情節，美影想起了祖母還在家中坐著喝茶時的畫面，雄一的媽媽說她穿毛衣很好看的情境等等，因為有了這些記憶的陪伴，美影才能渡過黑暗的時刻，為孤單的自己打氣。

				「對呀，不過人生如果沒有真正絕望過，不知道真正無法割捨的是自己哪個部份，就算長大了也無法懂得真正的快樂喔。」——《廚房》，吉本芭娜娜。
			</section>
			<section id="A3">
				真正的快樂是甚麼呢?在這個故事中，美影好幾次提到這樣的問題。我想，這應該是一個沒有答案的問題，因為快樂是相對的，而絕望也未必是不好的，因為它能讓我們嚐到真正快樂的感覺，這兩種情緒會一直不斷的交織在我們的生活，構成我們的生活。

				「失去惠理子後，我兩一直這樣漂浮在晦暗的空中，奔跑在光河中即將迎向一個高峰。」——《廚房》，吉本芭娜娜。
			</section>
			<section id="A3">
				這本書的訴說方式給人一種在夢境與真實間交替，虛虛實實的感覺，故事中有很多情節的巧合會讓人覺得不太真實，不太可能發生的事情，作者也讓夢裡的情節在真實世界中發生，而真實的事件又好像蒙上了一層霧那樣飄忽，所以閱讀的過程中，會有一種漂浮的感覺。我想是因為故事是從美影的第一人稱角度書寫，由於悲傷太過龐大，她尚未接受祖母及雄一媽媽惠理子去世的事實，她還未清醒過來認清真實，因此作者以虛實交替的方式將夢境與真實世界連接起來，以此呼應美影的心情與狀況。
			</section>
			<section id="A3">
				這本書中不斷提起孤單、寂寞等的字眼，但是給人的感覺卻不是黑暗摸不著盡頭的深淵，反而像是透出黃色光暈的廚房，讓人覺得溫馨，這就是陪伴的作用，吉本芭娜娜也輕輕的描寫，將陪伴穿插在情節當中，才能讓身心俱疲的兩位主角在這個過程中慢慢好起來。
